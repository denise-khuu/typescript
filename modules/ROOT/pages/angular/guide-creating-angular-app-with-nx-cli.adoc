== Creating Angular app with Nx

To create an angular app with Nx, we simply create an Nx workspace with angular preset using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
npx create-nx-workspace --preset=angular
----

The CLI will ask a series of questions and setup your workspace with an empty angular application.

Here we have given the workspace name as *nx-guide* and the app name as *nx-ng-app*. Let us have a look at the folder structure created by Nx CLI.

== Nx workspace folder structure

Every Nx workspace has the following folder structure:

[source]
----
myorg/
├── apps/
├── libs/
├── tools/
├── workspace.json
├── nx.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.base.json
----

Nx creates such a folder structure because it strongly supports the concept of monorepo, wherein all the inter-related applications and libraries are put together in the same repository for better maintenance, code-sharing and avoiding duplication of codes. 

As per the structure, all runnable applications should belong in the *apps/* directory. Supporting applications and libraries can be put in the *libs/* folder, with each library defining its own external API to differentiate between them. *tools/* folder can contain scripts which act on your code like database scripts, for example. The JSON files contain various information and configuration settings about the workspace and the projects within them.

You will find your angular app named *nx-ng-app* in the *apps/* folder. The folder structure within your app is similar to any Angular app created with Angular CLI.

.Your Nx workspace in VSCode.

You will also notice another app named *nx-ng-app-e2e* automatically generated in the *apps* folder. This for performing end-to-end testing with Cypress on your app. 

Now that we have created our angular app, let us serve it so we can view the application in our browser.

== Running your angular application

You can still use the `ng` command to serve your application from your workspace root directory as such:

[source, shell]
----
ng serve nx-ng-app
----

Using Nx, you can use either of the commands below for the same purpose:

[source, shell]
----
nx run my-app:serve
nx serve my-app
----

Once your code is compiled, you can view your application at http://localhost:4200 as usual.
